# UnsceneTravelApp
My application allows users to share and find overlooked or hidden travel activities outside of a typical “Top Ten” list. The simple layout makes the application easy to navigate and great for quickly adding or finding new travel ideas. Using authenticated user accounts, the application allows users to create activities and add/remove them to/from the user’s private list. Each activity includes a Name, Location, Description and HTML hyperlink for the geolocation. Users can easily view new travel activities in the form of a list. The hyperlink including the geolocation always opens a new tab when clicked. 

Features • Users can create and authenticate accounts. • Users can use CRUD functionality for managing activity list. • Users can view all shared activities in a simplified list. • Hyperlink with activity’s geolocation is included with each activity.

Technologies • C# • .NET • mySQL • CSS • HTML
